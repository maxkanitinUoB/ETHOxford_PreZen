# PreZen — Prediction Markets with Social Intelligence (UI Demo)

PreZen is a front-end dashboard concept for prediction markets, combining a **social intelligence feed** with **portfolio-style metrics** and **trade tooling** panels. This repo is a **UI/UX prototype** built with static HTML/CSS/JS (no backend, no real trading).

## What’s inside

### Key features (demo UI)

  - Top market metrics (volume, liquidity, open interest)
  - “Market Proportion” mini visualization
  - Embedded **Weekly Volume** chart via iframe
  - Social intelligence feed cards (community/news/market posts)
  - Right sidebar alerts + premium teaser cards

  - Larger blocks: Liquidity Truth Serum, Bias Scanner, Diversity Score
  - Arbitrage + Smart Order Router panels
  - Calibration training + progress widgets (demo interactions only)

- **Chat**
  - Real-time discussion space for market ideas, Q&A, and quick reactions.
  - Designed for short-form collaboration (signals, thesis updates, links).
  - Uses the same UI system (cards/buttons/icons) for consistency across pages.

- **Notifications**
  - Central hub for activity alerts (market updates, interactions, system events).
  - Badge-based highlight for unread items (quick scan).
  - Keeps important changes visible without disrupting the main workflow.

- **Saved**
  - Bookmark workspace for markets/posts you want to revisit later.
  - Helps track follow-ups (research later, trade later, compare signals).
  - Reduces clutter by separating “current browsing” vs “curated list”.

- **AI Signals**
  - AI-assisted insights layer (e.g., sentiment / anomaly-style signals) to support decisions.
  - Presented as “signals” rather than automated execution (informational UI).
  - Intended to complement the feed + trade tools (not replace them).

- **Settings**
  - Preference + account control center (privacy, notifications, basic profile options).
  - Place for UI personalization (e.g., appearance/theme) if extended later.
  - Keeps configuration separate from trading/analysis screens for clarity.

> This is a **design prototype**: values, charts, and signals are sample data for presentation.
